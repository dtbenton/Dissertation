<h1><u>Causal Discovery: How infants and adults represent complex causal events (Dissertation)</u></h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
</br>
Causal perception and causal reasoning are important abilities because they enable human reasoners to learn about the world around them. Despite the robust research on these two abilities, considerable disagreement exists about whether a Bayesian or associative mechanism underpins these abilities. In particular, open and as-yet unanswered questions remain about (1) whether infants and adults represent causal relations are graph structures and are sensitive to and can encode the Markov condition in such structures as would be predicted from the Bayes net account, (2) whether they can form equivalence classes in a paradigm that is more interpretable than—and thus does not suffer from the same limitations of—previous research (e.g.,Sobel and Kirkham, 2006, 2007; Steyvers et al. (2003), (3) and whether, and to what extent, infants' and adults' responses to causal sequences are consistent with predictions of the Bayes net account (e.g., Gopnik et al., 2004) or of the domain-general accounts (e.g., Benton & Rakison, 2017; Cohen et al., 1990); that is, it is unresolved (3) whether, how, and to what extent, upon forming an Markov equivalence class infants and adults respond equivalently to sequences that instantiate the same conditional independence relations or instead distinguish one sequence from another based on spatiotemporal differences or other low-level perceptual differences. The aim of the proposed dissertation experiments is to examine these questions to provide insight into the nature of causal learning in infants and adults.
